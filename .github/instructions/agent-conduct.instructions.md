# Agent Conduct & Interaction Rules

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Orchestration Checkpoint First

**BEFORE responding to ANY request with multiple steps (research + planning + implementation + testing + review):**

- Read the orchestration checkpoint in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#-critical-orchestration-checkpoint-read-first) and [subagent-workflow.instructions.md](./subagent-workflow.instructions.md#-before-starting-orchestration-checkpoint)
- Determine if this task requires a coordinator agent (Feature Builder, TDD) or can be single-agent work
- If multi-step work, document why you're using orchestrator-first in your response before proceeding

This applies to ANY task that involves 2+ of: research, planning, implementation, testing, validation, code review.

## Clarification & Assumption Handling

**CRITICAL**: Before making assumptions or proceeding with ambiguous requirements, agents MUST proactively ask the user for clarification. This applies to:

- **Ambiguous requirements**: If a task description is vague, incomplete, or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.
- **Architecture decisions**: When multiple valid approaches exist (e.g., adding a new service vs. extending an existing one), present options and ask for the user's preference.
- **Data model changes**: Before adding/modifying database columns, relationships, or entities, confirm the intended schema with the user.
- **Breaking changes**: If an implementation could break existing functionality, API contracts, or database compatibility, flag it and ask before proceeding.
- **Scope uncertainty**: If unsure whether a feature should be minimal (MVP) or comprehensive, ask about the desired scope.
- **External dependencies**: When a task requires secrets, third-party services, or infrastructure not yet configured, ask the user before assuming.
- **Domain-specific decisions**: Sensitive UX choices or domain-specific behavior should be confirmed with the user first.

## How to Ask for Clarification

- Be specific about what is unclear and why it matters
- Offer 2-3 concrete options when possible (with a recommended default)
- Explain the trade-offs of each option briefly
- If there is a clearly best practice, recommend it but still confirm

### Example

> "This endpoint could return paginated results or the full list. Given the expected data volume, I'd recommend pagination with a default page size of 20. Should I proceed with that approach, or do you prefer returning all results?"

## Decision Documentation

When a clarification is resolved:

1. **Record the decision** in a code comment or relevant documentation
2. **Reference the rationale** so future agents/developers understand why
3. **Update specs/plans** if the decision changes the original scope

## Guardrails

- **Never silently change** database schemas, API contracts, or auth flows without confirmation
- **Never assume scope** — if a task says "add search," ask whether it means basic text search, full-text search, or filter/facet search
- **Never skip tests** for assumed-correct behavior — confirm expectations first
- **Prefer reversible changes** when acting without full clarity
