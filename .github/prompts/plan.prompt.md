# Plan Feature Implementation

Plan how to implement the specified feature. This is the second step in the development lifecycle.

## Usage

```
/plan {{ISSUE_KEY}}-123
/plan docs/specs/user-authentication.md
```

## Orchestrator Checkpoint

> **🛑 Before starting**: For complex features spanning multiple domains (backend + frontend + API + docs),
> dispatch **Researcher** subagents in parallel to analyze each domain simultaneously.
> Use the `writing-plans` skill for structured plan creation.
> See `.github/instructions/subagent-workflow.instructions.md` for full patterns.

## Process

1. **Load Feature Context**:
   - Read specification from `docs/specs/{{FEATURE_NAME}}.md`
   - Review `AGENTS.md` for architecture patterns
   - Check `docs/constitution.md` for project principles

2. **Analyze Requirements**:
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Dependencies on existing code
   - External service integrations

3. **Generate Implementation Plan**:

   Create `docs/plans/{{FEATURE_NAME}}.md` with:

   - **Architecture Overview**: Component structure, data flow
   - **Tech Stack**: Libraries and frameworks to use
   - **File Structure**: Exact paths following project conventions
   - **API Design**: Input/output schemas (if applicable)
   - **Database Changes**: Schema modifications (if needed)
   - **Security Considerations**: Auth, validation, data protection
   - **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E approach
   - **Integration Points**: Dependencies on other features
   - **Parallelization Map**: Identify independent tasks that can be dispatched to parallel subagents during implementation (mark with `[P]`)

4. **Generate Additional Artifacts** (if needed):
   - `docs/research/{{FEATURE_NAME}}.md` - Technical research
   - `docs/models/{{FEATURE_NAME}}.md` - Data model details
   - `docs/contracts/{{FEATURE_NAME}}/` - API specifications

5. **Report Completion**:
   - Plan file path
   - Additional artifacts created
   - Ready for `/tasks` command

## Plan Template
