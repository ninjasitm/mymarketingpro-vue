# Generate Release Notes

Generate professional release notes from git commits. Supports three output formats: **web** (customer-facing), **git tag** (concise), and **documentation** (detailed technical).

## Usage

```
/release-notes web
/release-notes tag
/release-notes docs
```

## Process

1. **Determine Output Format**:

   Ask the user which format they need:

   | Format            | Purpose                                             | Audience                            | Length         |
   | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
   | **Web**           | Website changelog, blog post, customer announcement | End users, customers                | 200-500 words  |
   | **Git Tag**       | Git tag annotation, GitHub/GitLab release           | Developers, external consumers      | 100-300 words  |
   | **Documentation** | RELEASE_NOTES.md, comprehensive changelog           | Internal developers, technical team | 500-2000 words |

2. **Gather Commit Data**:

   Run these commands to collect release information:

   ```bash
   # Get commits in range
   git log --oneline --since="[START_DATE]" --until="[END_DATE]"

   # Get detailed commit info
   git log --since="[START_DATE]" --format="%h|%s|%b|%an|%ad" --date=short

   # Get changed files
   git diff --stat [START_REF]..[END_REF]

   # Get commits by conventional type
   git log --oneline --grep="^feat" --since="[START_DATE]"
   git log --oneline --grep="^fix" --since="[START_DATE]"
   git log --oneline --grep="^perf" --since="[START_DATE]"
   ```

3. **Analyze Commits**:

   - Extract conventional commit type (feat, fix, perf, refactor, etc.)
   - Identify scope (auth, frontend, admin, etc.)
   - Group related commits together
   - Determine user/developer impact

4. **Generate Release Notes** using the appropriate template below.
