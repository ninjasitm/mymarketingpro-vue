## Agent Conduct & Interaction Rules

### Clarification & Assumption Handling

**CRITICAL**: Before making assumptions or proceeding with ambiguous requirements, agents MUST proactively ask the user for clarification. This applies to:

- **Ambiguous requirements**: If a task description is vague, incomplete, or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.
- **Architecture decisions**: When multiple valid approaches exist (e.g., adding a new service vs. extending an existing one), present options and ask for the user's preference.
- **Data model changes**: Before adding/modifying database columns, relationships, or entities, confirm the intended schema with the user.
- **Breaking changes**: If an implementation could break existing functionality, API contracts, or database compatibility, flag it and ask before proceeding.
- **Scope uncertainty**: If unsure whether a feature should be minimal (MVP) or comprehensive, ask about the desired scope.
- **External dependencies**: When a task requires secrets, third-party services, or infrastructure not yet configured, ask the user before assuming.
- **Domain-specific decisions**: Sensitive UX choices or domain-specific behavior should be confirmed with the user first.

### How to Ask for Clarification

- Be specific about what is unclear and why it matters
- Offer 2-3 concrete options when possible (with a recommended default)
- Explain the trade-offs of each option briefly
- If there is a clearly best practice, recommend it but still confirm

**Example:**

> "This endpoint could return paginated results or the full list. Given the expected data volume, I'd recommend pagination with a default page size of 20. Should I proceed with that approach, or do you prefer returning all results?"

### Guardrails

- **Never silently change** database schemas, API contracts, or auth flows without confirmation
- **Never assume scope** — if a task says "add search," ask whether it means basic text search, full-text search, or filter/facet search
- **Never skip tests** for assumed-correct behavior — confirm expectations first
- **Prefer reversible changes** when acting without full clarity

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Orchestration Checkpoint (READ FIRST)

**BEFORE starting ANY multi-step task, MUST read this section:**

If your work involves **2+ of these activities**, you MUST use orchestrator-first flow:

- Research / exploration
- Planning / specification
- Implementation / code changes
- Testing / validation
- Review / quality gate

**Common patterns requiring orchestration:**

- Feature development (research + build + test + review)
- Bug fix analysis (diagnose + plan + implement + validate)
- API design (spec + implement + integrate + test)
- Multi-file refactoring (plan + change multiple files + validate)

**Quick decision tree:**

- Single file edit? → Direct implementation OK
- 2+ independent fixes? → Use subagent flow (dispatch parallel agents)
- Feature with planning + implementation + review? → Use Feature Builder coordinator
- Behavior-driven development? → Use TDD coordinator
- Uncertain? → Read "Recommended Flow" below

**Cost of skipping this:**

- Wastes tokens on sequential work that could parallelize
- Breaks established workflow expectations
- Loses benefits of specialist domain routing
- Reduces code review quality (less context isolation)
- Single-agent work accumulates cognitive load

---

## Preferred Workflow: Orchestrator + Subagents

**Use a coordinator agent (orchestrator) as the default approach for non-trivial work.** Coordinators break complex tasks into focused subtasks and dispatch specialized subagents, each with context isolation and domain expertise.

### When to use orchestrator + subagents

- Features spanning multiple files or domains
- Tasks requiring planning → implementation → review cycles
- Work that benefits from domain specialization (backend, frontend, API)
- Any task with 2+ independent subtasks

### When to use a single agent directly

- Quick one-file fixes or small edits
- Research questions that don't require code changes
- Ad-hoc code reviews (invoke Reviewer directly)
- Simple documentation updates

### Subagent Guidance

Use custom agents when you want explicit coordinator and worker roles. Use workflow skills when you want tighter manual control over the same process.

#### When to Delegate

- Use `Feature Builder` for feature work that needs research, planning, implementation, and review in one coordinated flow.
- Use `TDD` when requirements are behavior-driven and you want explicit red-green-refactor execution.
- Prefer orchestrator-first execution for multi-step work and route tasks to domain specialists when possible.
- Use `Researcher` directly for read-only exploration.
- Use `Backend Architect`, `Frontend Developer`, `API Specialist`, `Admin Portal`, and `Documenter` for focused domain tasks.
- Use `subagent-driven-development` after `writing-plans` when you have a written implementation plan and want to stay in the current session.
- Use `dispatching-parallel-agents` only when tasks are independent, do not share state, and are unlikely to touch the same files.
- Use `requesting-code-review` after each task in subagent-driven development, after each major task in ad-hoc work, and before merge so issues do not cascade.
- Use `executing-plans` instead of `subagent-driven-development` when you want a separate execution session rather than same-session orchestration.

#### Operating Rules

- Give each subagent a narrow scope, the exact task text, and the context it needs to act safely.
- Treat `Planner`, `Implementer`, `Reviewer`, `Red`, `Green`, and `Refactor` as worker agents intended for coordinator-led handoff.
- Do not make an implementation subagent read the plan file on its own; pass the relevant task directly.
- In `subagent-driven-development`, keep the review order strict: spec compliance first, then code quality.
- If a reviewer finds issues, fix them and re-run the same review before moving on.
- Do not run multiple implementation subagents in parallel when they could touch shared packages, shared docs, or the same app surface.

#### Recommended Flow

1. Use `brainstorming` if requirements or scope are still fuzzy.
2. Use `writing-plans` to produce a concrete implementation plan.
3. Use `subagent-driven-development` for same-session execution or `executing-plans` for a separate execution session.
4. Use `dispatching-parallel-agents` only for independent investigations or non-overlapping tasks.
5. Use `requesting-code-review` and `verification-before-completion` before claiming the work is done.

> **Delegation patterns:** See `.github/instructions/subagent-workflow.instructions.md`.

### How to invoke

- "Use the Feature Builder agent to implement this feature" → Coordinator orchestrates full lifecycle
- "Run the TDD agent for this requirement" → TDD coordinator manages red-green-refactor
- "Use the Backend Architect to design the database schema" → Domain specialist works directly
- "Review my recent changes" → Reviewer works directly on git diff

## Custom Agents (Subagents)

Custom agents enable **context-isolated delegation** — a coordinator agent breaks complex tasks into subtasks and dispatches specialized subagents, each with their own tools and focus.

### Available Agents

Agent definitions live in `.github/agents/` (GitHub Copilot) and `.cursor/agents/` (Cursor):

#### Coordinators

Coordinators orchestrate workflows by dispatching worker and specialist agents.

| Agent               | Tools                     | Agents                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Builder** | agent, edit, search, read | Planner, Implementer, Reviewer, Researcher, Backend Architect, Frontend Developer, API Specialist, Admin Portal, Documenter | End-to-end feature development orchestration |
| **TDD**             | agent, edit, search, read | Red, Green, Refactor                                                                                                        | Red-green-refactor cycle coordination        |

#### Domain Specialists

Specialists have deep expertise in a specific domain. They can be invoked directly or dispatched by coordinators.

| Agent                  | Tools                        | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Architect**  | read, search, edit, terminal | API design, databases, system architecture, security    |
| **Frontend Developer** | read, search, edit, terminal | UI components, state management, responsive design      |
| **API Specialist**     | read, search, edit, terminal | API contracts, documentation, versioning, integration   |
| **Admin Portal**       | read, search, edit, terminal | RBAC, dashboards, reporting, analytics, monitoring      |
| **Documenter**         | read, search, edit, terminal | AGENTS.md, README, API docs, architecture documentation |
| **Reviewer**           | read, search, terminal       | Multi-perspective code review (also usable directly)    |

#### Process Workers

Workers are dispatched by coordinators and are not directly user-invocable.

| Agent           | Tools                        | Purpose                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Planner**     | read, search                 | Break down features into implementation tasks |
| **Implementer** | read, search, edit, terminal | Write production code following TDD           |
| **Researcher**  | read, search                 | Codebase analysis without changes             |
| **Red**         | read, search, edit, terminal | Write failing tests (TDD red phase)           |
| **Green**       | read, search, edit, terminal | Write minimal code to pass tests (TDD green)  |
| **Refactor**    | read, search, edit, terminal | Improve code quality, keep tests green        |

### Orchestration Patterns

**Coordinator → Specialist/Worker**: Feature Builder dispatches domain specialists (Backend Architect, Frontend Developer, etc.) based on the task domain, and process workers (Planner, Reviewer, Researcher) for workflow stages.

**Domain Matching**: Choose the specialist whose expertise matches the task:

- Backend changes → Backend Architect
- UI changes → Frontend Developer
- API contracts/docs → API Specialist
- Admin dashboards, RBAC, reporting, monitoring → Admin Portal
- General implementation → Implementer

**Sequential**: Tasks with dependencies are implemented one at a time.
**Parallel**: Independent tasks can be dispatched to multiple subagents simultaneously.

### Invoking Subagents

Subagents are typically **agent-initiated** — the coordinator decides when to delegate. You can also hint:

- "Use the Feature Builder agent to implement this feature"
- "Run the TDD agent for this requirement"
- "Use the Backend Architect to design the database schema"
- "Use the Documenter to update the project documentation"
- "Use a subagent to research how authentication works in this codebase"

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation updates are **mandatory before committing** any feature or fix. See [`.github/instructions/documentation.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/documentation.instructions.md) for the full pre-commit checklist, templates, and AI agent directives.

**Quick summary:**

- Create or update `docs/features/{{ISSUE_ID}}-FEATURE-NAME/` (spec + plan) for every feature
- Add fixes to the monthly log in `docs/fixes/{YYYY-MM}.md` (or a dedicated folder for complex fixes)
- Update `docs/api/`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` when applicable
- Include all doc changes in the same commit/PR as the code

## Contributing
